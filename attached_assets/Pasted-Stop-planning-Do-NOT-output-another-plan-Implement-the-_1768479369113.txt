Stop planning. Do NOT output another plan. Implement the code now by creating/updating files in the workspace.

CONTEXT:
You already described the plan for a ZEON fintech MVP (Next.js 14 App Router + TS + Tailwind + Prisma SQLite + Recharts). Now you must produce a running codebase.

ABSOLUTE RULES:
- Do not write another plan.
- Create the full project code in the workspace.
- Ensure `npm install` and `npm run dev` will run without TypeScript errors.
- At the end, print a concise file tree and exact run instructions.
- If something is missing in the Replit workspace, scaffold it inside the workspace (create package.json, configs, etc).

TECH STACK (strict):
- Next.js 14+ App Router, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with CSS variables theme tokens (Anthropic-inspired warm neutrals + calm accent)
- Prisma + SQLite
- Recharts
- Zod
- lucide-react icons (set icon size: 18 for normal buttons, 16 for small)
- Amounts stored as integer minor units as string, never floats

MVP PAGES (must exist):
/ (Home)
/analytics
/invest
/invest/[id]
/invest/[id]/confirm
/wallet
/wallet/vaults
/deposit/usdt
/deposit/card
/withdraw
/activity
/activity/[operationId]
/settings
/settings/security

MVP FEATURES (must work end-to-end with demo data):
1) App shell responsive:
   - desktop sidebar + mobile bottom nav
2) Charts with 7/30/90 toggle:
   - Home: portfolio chart
   - Analytics: portfolio + monthly bars + cashflow tiles
   - Strategy detail: compare chart (strategy vs benchmark) with benchmark selector BTC/ETH/USDT/Index
   - Tooltips + cursor/crosshair feel
3) Activity:
   - search + filter chips
   - receipt page with timeline + detail rows + copy buttons
   - use a single operation copy mapping layer
4) Cashflow view:
   - Net Deposits, Invested(current), Realized P&L, Unrealized P&L
5) Vaults:
   - Principal/Profit/Taxes
   - wallet<->vault transfers
   - auto-sweep toggle: after DAILY_PAYOUT, move profit to Profit vault (create separate operation)
6) Security Center:
   - 2FA toggle (demo)
   - anti-phishing code (demo)
   - address whitelist enable/disable
   - new address delay (0/24h)
   - withdrawal gating: if whitelist enabled, withdraw only to active whitelisted addresses; if delay enabled, new address pending activation
7) Demo flows:
   - simulate USDT deposit credited
   - simulate card deposit credited
   - invest creates op and updates balances/invested
   - daily payout creates op and updates balances (+ auto-sweep if enabled)
   - withdraw creates op and updates balances (blocked by security rules)

DATABASE (Prisma):
- Add schema.prisma with models needed for the features above.
- Create a seed script that generates deterministic demo data:
  - portfolio series 90 days with ~4-5% monthly drift + noise
  - quotes for BTC/ETH/USDT-RUB 90 days
  - 2 strategies
  - operations history with mixed types and statuses
  - balances (RUB, USDT, invested USDT)
  - vault balances (principal/profit/taxes)
  - security settings (2FA off by default, whitelist off by default)
- Provide npm scripts to migrate and seed:
  - prisma migrate
  - prisma db seed

API ROUTES (Next.js route handlers):
- GET /api/bootstrap
- GET /api/operations (cursor + filter + q)
- GET /api/operations/[id]
- POST /api/consent/accept
- POST /api/kyc/start (demo approve)
- POST /api/deposit/usdt/simulate
- POST /api/deposit/card/simulate
- POST /api/fx/quote (demo)
- POST /api/invest
- POST /api/payout/daily
- POST /api/withdraw/usdt
- POST /api/vault/transfer
- POST /api/security/2fa/toggle
- POST /api/security/whitelist/toggle
- POST /api/security/whitelist/add
- POST /api/security/whitelist/remove
- POST /api/security/address-delay
- POST /api/security/anti-phishing

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Calm, premium, minimal, no loud gradients
- Use Tailwind + CSS variables
- Tabular numbers for amounts
- Consistent type scale and spacing scale
- Buttons min height 44px; icon sizes fixed

IMPLEMENTATION ORDER (do it in code, not in text):
1) Scaffold project + Tailwind theme tokens
2) Prisma schema + seed + scripts
3) API routes
4) Shared UI components + layout
5) Pages + charts + interactions
6) Activity search/filter + receipts
7) Vaults + Security gating

Now implement everything. When done, print:
- file tree
- commands to run
- any known limitations (short list)
