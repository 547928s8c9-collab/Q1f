You are building a fintech web MVP called “ZEON” in a Replit workspace.

GOAL:
Create a production-grade, responsive fintech dashboard (Revolut-like structure) with an “Anthropic-inspired” soft minimal design: warm neutrals, calm accent, clean typography, lots of whitespace, clear money statuses.

TECH STACK (strict):
- Next.js 14+ App Router, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Recharts for charts (Line/Area/Bar with Tooltip and crosshair-like cursor)
- Prisma + SQLite (for Replit simplicity)
- Zod for validation
- Lucide icons (or inline SVG), ensure icons fit buttons consistently

DATA RULES (strict):
- Money amounts are integer minor units stored as string (e.g. "12345"), never floats.
- Assets: RUB (2 decimals), USDT (6 decimals). Network: TRC20.
- Use RFC3339 timestamps.
- Every user-facing money action creates an Operation record with a status state machine.

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT (MVP):
1) App shell:
   - Mobile bottom nav + Desktop sidebar
   - Routes: Home, Analytics, Invest, Wallet, Activity, Settings
2) Charts + period toggles:
   - Period switch: 7 / 30 / 90 days on Home, Analytics, Strategy detail charts
   - Portfolio chart (USDT) with Tooltip + cursor (crosshair feel)
   - Quotes cards with sparklines: BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, USDT/RUB (demo data)
3) Strategy detail “performance sheet”:
   - Compare chart: strategy equity vs benchmark
   - Benchmark selector: BTC / ETH / USDT (0%) / Index (50/50 BTC+ETH)
   - Metric tiles: Return %, Max Drawdown %, Win rate %, Fees text
4) Activity:
   - Search box (search in title, subtitle, amount, txHash, providerRef, strategy name)
   - Filter chips: All / Deposits / Withdrawals / Invest / Payouts / FX / Subscription / KYC
   - Receipt page: timeline steps + detail rows + copy buttons
   - Use a single Operation copy mapping layer (type+status -> title/subtitle/eta/reason).
5) Cashflow view (Analytics):
   - Show KPI tiles: Net Deposits, Invested (current), Realized P&L, Unrealized P&L
   - Unrealized = investedCurrent - investedPrincipal (principal from INVEST ops)
   - Realized = sum of DAILY_PAYOUT completed ops
   - Convert RUB deposits into USDT using current demo USDT/RUB quote (note: demo only)
6) Vaults:
   - Vaults: Principal, Profit, Taxes (USDT denominated for MVP)
   - Transfers wallet <-> vault with operations and balance updates
   - Auto-sweep toggle: after DAILY_PAYOUT credited, automatically move credited profit to Profit Vault (create separate operation)
7) Security Center (Settings -> Security):
   - 2FA toggle (demo), anti-phishing code (demo), address book/whitelist (demo), new address delay (0/24h)
   - Whitelist gating: if whitelist enabled, USDT withdraw can only go to active whitelisted addresses
   - Delay gating: newly added address is “pending activation” for 24h (demo time simulation)

SCREENS (must exist):
- / (Home)
- /analytics (Analytics + cashflow)
- /invest (Strategy list)
- /invest/[id] (Strategy detail with compare chart + benchmark selector + metrics)
- /invest/[id]/confirm
- /wallet (balances + deposit/withdraw links + vault entry)
- /wallet/vaults
- /deposit/usdt (TRC20 address + simulate deposit)
- /deposit/card (simulate card topup)
- /withdraw (USDT TRC20 withdraw with whitelist checks)
- /activity (search+filters list)
- /activity/[operationId] (receipt)
- /settings
- /settings/security

BACKEND (Next.js API routes):
- GET /api/bootstrap (gate + balances + portfolio series + quotes + vaults summary)
- GET /api/operations (cursor pagination + filter + q)
- GET /api/operations/:id
- POST /api/consent/accept
- POST /api/kyc/start (demo -> approve)
- POST /api/deposit/usdt/simulate
- POST /api/deposit/card/simulate
- POST /api/fx/quote (demo)
- POST /api/invest
- POST /api/payout/daily (demo)
- POST /api/withdraw/usdt
- POST /api/vault/transfer
- POST /api/security/2fa/enable (demo)
- POST /api/security/whitelist/add (demo)
- POST /api/security/whitelist/remove (demo)
- POST /api/security/whitelist/toggle
- POST /api/security/address-delay (0/24h)
- POST /api/security/anti-phishing (demo)

GATING (must):
- bootstrap returns gate flags:
  - consentRequired, kycRequired
  - canDeposit, canInvest, canWithdraw
  - reasons[] for UI
- Invest and Withdraw blocked until consent + kyc are satisfied
- Withdraw blocked if 2FA is not enabled
- Withdraw blocked if whitelist enabled and destination not active/allowed

DESIGN:
- Implement Tailwind theme tokens with CSS variables:
  - background/surface/border/text/muted/primary/success/warn/error
  - Anthropic-inspired warm neutrals + calm accent
- Typography:
  - use system-ui by default, tabular-nums for amounts
  - consistent font scale and line heights
- Buttons:
  - min height 44px
  - icons fixed: 18px (md), 16px (sm)
- Focus states: :focus-visible rings everywhere

DEMO DATA:
Seed deterministic demo data:
- portfolio equity series ~4-5% monthly drift with noise
- quotes series for BTC/ETH/USDT-RUB
- strategies: at least 2
- operations: include deposits, invest, daily payouts, withdrawals, subscription, fx
- positions: user invested in 1 strategy
- vault balances: principal/profit/taxes (small demo values)

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate the full codebase with Prisma schema and seed script.
- Provide a clear file tree and README with:
  - install
  - prisma migrate/seed
  - run dev
- Ensure the app runs in Replit with one command (npm run dev).
- Keep the UI calm and premium; no loud gradients; avoid clutter.

Start by scaffolding the Next.js project in the Replit workspace, then implement Prisma, seed data, API routes, UI screens, and shared components. Do not stop at partial scaffolding; deliver a working MVP that I can run.
