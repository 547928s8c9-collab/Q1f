Stop planning. Perform a strict code audit and fix issues.

GOAL:
Audit the ZEON Next.js + Prisma codebase for correctness, missing implementations, and bugs. Then implement fixes directly in code.

WHAT TO CHECK (must):
1) Build & TypeScript:
   - `npm run build` must pass (no TS errors).
   - no `any` leaks in critical money paths (balances, operations, payouts).
   - fix lint issues if configured.

2) Prisma & DB:
   - `npx prisma validate` must pass.
   - `npx prisma migrate dev` must succeed from a clean DB.
   - `npx prisma db seed` must succeed deterministically.
   - ensure schema types for money use string for minor units.

3) API correctness:
   - /api/bootstrap returns the full required payload (balances, vaults, portfolio series, quotes series, gate flags, onboarding state if present).
   - all UI pages must read data from API routes + Prisma (no hardcoded mock arrays in pages/components).
   - POST endpoints must validate input (Zod) and return consistent error codes.

4) Operations integrity:
   - Every money action creates an Operation record (deposit, invest, fx, payout, withdraw, vault transfer, redemption).
   - Operation statuses transition correctly (PENDING/PROCESSING/CONFIRMING/COMPLETED/FAILED/ON_HOLD).
   - Activity and Receipt read only from Operations and always find matching receipts.

5) Money invariants:
   - balances never go negative (server-side enforced).
   - payout net = gross - networkFee; if net < minPayout => payout skipped and payable remains.
   - weekly principal redemption is scheduled and executed only on weekly job run.
   - pending operations must NOT be counted into cashflow totals.

6) Security & gating:
   - invest/withdraw/payout settings require consent + KYC approved.
   - withdraw requires 2FA enabled.
   - whitelist + delay rules are enforced server-side (not only UI).

TASKS TO DO (output requirements):
A) Run/execute checks in this order:
   1. npm run build
   2. npx prisma validate
   3. npx prisma migrate dev
   4. npx prisma db seed
B) Fix ALL issues found (code changes required).
C) Add minimal automated checks:
   - add npm scripts:
     - "check": runs typecheck + build + prisma validate
     - "db:reset": resets db + migrate + seed
D) At the end, output:
   - EXACT commands you ran and their results
   - list of files changed
   - short list of remaining known limitations (if any)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Do not add new features.
- Do not change UI design.
- Focus on correctness and missing implementations.
- Keep money amounts as string minor units everywhere.
Implement now.
